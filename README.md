# picar-demo-srb

Stoyan Rosenov Boyukliyski Submission - IoT Devices Coursework

This is the full code for Picar - Rasberry Pi 4 project for smart autonomous driving car

The project can be executed using :


python3 ./picar-demo-srb/Picar-functioning/picar-moving-autonomously.py

After this the module will start and if the hardware is assembed correctly the car will start moving and avoiding collisions using an ultrasonic sensor.

Additionally, the car will print out the RGB sensors reading and will be able to tell if the car is crossing a white-black boundary or not (without connecting this to any motor functionality).

The instructions for assembly can be found on the following website:
